##Marking Duplicates in bam files

####The bam files that I aligned with subread do not have duplicates marked. These steps mark duplicates and eventually output text files containing all of the stats that come out of samtools flagstat


Ran on  test Midway2, Gilad partition with 12G of memory 2/17/19 using only one bam file

takes about 25 min per bam file

MarkDupFlagstatNoLoops.sh can be found in code directory-- (will find a way to echo it here)
```{r eval=F}
#from the CM_TC_ATAC/19209_and_19238/bam directory
sbatch --partition=gilad --mem=12G MarkDupFlagstatNoLoops.sh *.bam
```
